This is an Apache Cordova project for recreating the MS-DOS version of Classic Concentration!

I do not own the intellectual property so this project is not to be distributed or published to the Apple App Store or Google Play.

This was also made as a bit of a code jam, so some of this code may be ugly (looking at those SVG Sprites in index.html...).
